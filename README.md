SCITAB is a chrome extensions that can generate a csv file for all currently opening tabs.
As a researcher, you might often run into situations where tens of tabs are opened when you are searching for literature.
Sometimes it could be difficult to retrieve back the tab with the desired information, not even to mention the risk of your computer crashes.

SCITAB, equipped with a basic filter for identifying whether the tab's link is a sci journal, can generate a csv file for user based on their preferences.
Users can also provide their own keywords and filter the tabs as they desire.

The chrome extension is currenly going through the publishing process in the chrome store. For current use, download the zip file and upload the document to the chrome under developer mode. I am sure there is tons of tutorials of how to upload unpublished chrome extension.
